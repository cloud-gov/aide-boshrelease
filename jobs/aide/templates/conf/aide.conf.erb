#AIDE conf

# Here are all the things we can check - these are the default rules
#
#p:      permissions
#ftype:  file type
#i:      inode
#n:      number of links
#l:      link name
#u:      user
#g:      group
#s:      size
#b:      block count
#m:      mtime
#a:      atime
#c:      ctime
#S:      check for growing size
#I:      ignore changed filename
#ANF:    allow new files
#ARF:    allow removed files
#md5:    md5 checksum
#sha1:   sha1 checksum
#sha256: sha256 checksum
#sha512: sha512 checksum
#rmd160: rmd160 checksum
#tiger:  tiger checksum
#haval:  haval checksum
#crc32:  crc32 checksum
#R:      p+ftype+i+l+n+u+g+s+m+c+md5
#L:      p+ftype+i+l+n+u+g
#E:      Empty group
#>:      Growing file p+ftype+l+u+g+i+n+S
#The following are available if you have mhash support enabled:
#gost:   gost checksum
#whirlpool: whirlpool checksum
#The following are available and added to the default groups R, L and >
#only when explicitly enabled using configure:
#acl:    access control list
#selinux SELinux security context
#xattrs:  extended file attributes
#e2fsattrs: file attributes on a second extended file system

# You can also create custom rules like:
# (most of these borrowed from Tripwire)
TEMPFILE = p+ftype+u+g+ANF+ARF
# this is L from above, but without inode checks
LNOI = p+ftype+l+n+u+g
RNOIMC = p+ftype+l+n+u+g+s+md5

# ignore extras from config - need to come before adds to be honored
